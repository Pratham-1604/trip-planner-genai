      "[{'title': 'I traveled through India for 15 Days (New Delhi, Jaipur, Udaipur): my honest experience.', 'comments': ['I did the same route as you but had a terrible experience in Udaipur. I won\\'t blame the city for my inconveniences, but I feel like Udaipur\\'s \"nice\" walkable part is not as nice and walkable as people may think. And once you are out of that touristy oasis, It\\'s a regular north Indian city. I wouldn\\'t recommend it for a digital nomad but for a 2/3 day trip, It\\'s cool. Those few streets where cars are not allowed are indeed an oasis in India.', 'Nice.\\n\\nI hear the Southern states are easier for beginners. Eg Kerela, Goa, Tamil Nadu etc.\\n\\nSmart move regarding hygeine. You chose wisely.', 'Glad you enjoyed it. I’m an Indian living abroad and I really enjoyed doing Udaipur -> Khumbalgarh -> Jodhpur when I was younger. \\n\\nWhere were you guys staying though? I feel like most of the drawbacks could be avoided by staying at any of the big resorts in the area. \\n\\nMy parents can speak Hindi and have experience traveling in India but we still always got a driver recommendation from the resort, and it was so helpful because they know what places to go to, what restaurants are safe, and can keep you out of the less attractive areas. \\n\\nMight be a bit less “authentic” but it’s less stress and less overwhelming.', \"I went on a similar trip, including Jodhpur and a small town. That's cool you went to Chandni Chowk. It seemed like a journey just to walk a few blocks.\", 'I’ve been to India going on about 8 times, and always look for chances to return. It can be challenging at times and I wouldn’t recommend for an inexperienced traveller, but I’ve always had a great time that was well worth it.\\n\\nMy favourite itineraries have been Bangalore - Mysore - Ooty - Bangalore, or Chennai - Mahabalipuram - Pondicherry - Chennai. Both take in sites well worth seeing, but are just a little off the typical tourist trails where the less fun experiences might be more common.\\n\\nI’ve also never found a place where conversation can start up so easily with locals. Obviously it’s good to have awareness of who you’re talking to, but I had a great time at the recent World Cup watching 10 hours of cricket, and chatting to the people beside who were curious why I was there. No one had ill intent. At the end, they all just said goodbye, wished me a nice trip, and that was that.', 'I did the golden triangle tour, OP is spot on. I felt very safe in the areas visited, taking a train was a unique experience, and New Delhi has air pollution. The time spent in New Delhi during hair washing, the rinse water came out black from the pollution.', 'I was born in the US but my parents are from India so we went almost every other summer vacation growing up. It gets better overtime for sure but as I got older, I began to see the uncomfortable stares that my mom or other female relatives would encounter when walking to places just outside our apartment. I also didn’t mind the hustle and bustle as a kid because it just seemed “cool” and like an amusement park to me. As I got older I realized how dirty it actually is and unhygienic. I’ve had my fair share of getting sick in India to now know what not to do lol. Thanks for this review as it highlights the truth and not just hyping up tourist destinations. India isn’t a bad country to visit, but definitely not a beginner country.', 'I did a similar route at the ends of last summer. Skipped Udaipur and went up to Dharamshala instead.\\n\\nI wouldn’t call it my favorite country because reality is that it can be hot, dirty, and inconvenient. And I don’t recommend it for first-time visitors to Asia.\\n\\nThat said, I enjoyed everywhere I went in India except Delhi. Most people are very friendly and most of the food is delicious, and there are memorable experiences, from festivals to serene temples to beautiful landscapes to be found everywhere. And while it may be chaotic, I wouldn’t call India dangerous or unsafe at all. India is definitely a feast for the senses in so many ways.', 'This post resonates. I’m currently in the midst of a 3 week business trip with various side personal excursions. I’m currently in Mumbai and am constantly loving it or ready to leave the country entirely. \\n\\nApart from the hygiene and pollution as noted, the biggest thing for me is simply leaving the comfort of the hotel. No matter how many times I’ve done it, you know you’re stepping out into heat, constant stares, unsafe sidewalks, overwhelming smells, hanging electrical wires everywhere, cows, sleeping and rabid dogs and the list goes on. It took me about 2 hours this morning to build up the motivation to leave my hotel. \\n\\nFor some weird reason, I love it and am extremely sad to leave India and long to come back as soon as possible. I think the extreme hospitality and kindness of the people is what I love above all.', \"The issues you mentioned are prevalent and sadly everyone including Indian travellers face it. And ofcourse you did one of overly populated journey with these 3 cities, but Rajasthan is known for its hospitality. So I am not surprised you were well welcomed \\n\\nFor you next trip, plan to do Kerala, Himachal, Leh and North Eastern part of India.. especially Meghalaya. \\n\\nAnd thanks for sharing your experience. I know India is a terrible destination as compared to other Asian countries, but we are growing. We have always been a spiritual and cultural tourist destination. And still it doesn't disappoint for people coming from abroad. But don't think we are ready for leisurely travels. Cheers!\", 'I just got back from Delhi (with a brief side trip to a village in Uttar Pradesh) and your description is so perfectly accurate. Delhi was major sensory overload for me but I also really enjoyed my time there. Just a constant barrage of colorful sights, smells, and a cacophony of sound.', 'I\\'ll never go back to Chandni Chowk. My last time there, I ended up walking behind the Indian woman I was there with, swatting away endless gropey little fingers with a water bottle for her in that \"river of humanity.\" Was absolutely disgusting. Forget that.', 'This is super helpful, thanks for sharing.', 'Next time if you head to north India, highly recommend Jaisalmer', 'The Taj shouldn’t be done as a day trip. You should go at dawn before the tourists arrive and take a boat ride out on the Yamuna River to watch the sunrise. It’s magical.', 'Udaipur is incredible – one of my favorite cities in India, and certainly one of the most beautiful. Lots of good day trips around it too – I really enjoyed visiting Chittor Fort in Chittorgarh when I was there.', '[removed]', '**Notice:** Are you asking for travel advice about India?\\n\\nRead what redditors had to say in the **[weekly destination thread for India](http://redd.it/2vf6wa)**         \\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But obviously you do have to go out of your way for Lucknow.\\n\\nIf you're going to Jaipur you should also check out Udaipur. I think it's even better than Jaipur. More forgiving weather and some beautiful architecture there too.\", '¡Qué buen reporte! Me encantó el nivel de detalle, se nota que planeaste bien el recorrido. Coincido en que el Triángulo Dorado puede ser un reto para viajeros solitarios, pero tus consejos sobre Uber, tours a pie y el metro son muy útiles. ¡Espero la parte de Vietnam y China!', 'May I ask how did you book your train tickets?

I only went to India for Taj Mahal so I just needed that to be checked on my list. \\n\\nI heard about Udaipur while I was traveling so  I definitely missed it. \\n\\nWould comeback to other places to explore once I'm done with my world wonder goals.\", \"Thank you so much!

Sit and relax on the Ghats (Ambrai or Gangaur) and for food there are tons of options although nothing really unique. You can try Khamma Gani restaurant.', 'Thanks for your recommendation!
